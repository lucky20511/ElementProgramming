# Strategies for Interview

#### Resume

1.Clear statement of Objective

2.The ones differentiate you from others

3.High quality with no errors

#### Coding for Interview v.s Coding in industry

1.Take correctness, simplicity, space and time complexity as top priority.

2.Keep variable name short and clear.

3.Don't need to use setter and getter

### Approaching the problem

1.Clarify the problem

2.Work on concrete examples

3.Spell out brute-force solution

* Need to care about the case if it takes a long time to describe the brute-force method.

4.Think out loud

5.Apply patterns

* e.g. HashMap, Recursion, DP, slow fast pointer, topological sorting
* Detect cycle in DG     1. Topological Sorting         2. Backtracking with a HashMap \(single head\)

* Detect cycle in Directed line   1. Fast slow pointer      2. HashMap

* Detect cycle in UDG   1. Union-find  --  cycle : union two nodes already with same group
