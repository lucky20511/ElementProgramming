# Strategies for Interview

#### Resume

1.Clear statement of Objective

2.The ones differentiate you from others

3.High quality with no errors

4.Know your company \(which kind of engineer they want to hire\)

#### Coding for Interview v.s Coding in industry

1.Take correctness, simplicity, space and time complexity as top priority.

2.Keep variable name short and clear.

3.Don't need to use setter and getter

## Approaching the problem

**1.Clarify the problem**

**2.Work on concrete examples**

**3.Spell out brute-force solution**

* Need to care about the case if it takes a long time to describe the brute-force method.

**4.Think out loud**

**5.Apply patterns**

* e.g. HashMap, Recursion, DP, slow fast pointer, topological sorting

* Detect cycle in DG     1. Topological Sorting         2. Backtracking with a HashMap \(single head\)

* Detect cycle in Directed line   1. Fast slow pointer      2. HashMap

* Detect cycle in UDG   1. Union-find  --  cycle : union two nodes already with same group

## Presenting the Solution

**1.Take use of libraries \(Data Structure\)**

**2.Focus on the top level algorithm**

* Always make interviewer clearly understand your main flow of solution

* It's ok to use the functions that you will implement later.

**3.Manage the whiteboard \(Save space\)**

**4.Assume valid inputs**

* Should clarify the assumption with interviewer

* Pay attention on regular case first, Then, come up with corner cases as more as possible to test your solution.

**5.Avoid Syntax Error \(Typo\)**

## What Interviewer want to get from the conversation with you

1. **Clearly communicate a complex idea**
2. **Passion about his work**
3. **Potential Interest matches with some projects -- many teams prefer generalist**
